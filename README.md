chrisweb utilities.js 0.1.2
===========================

This project is not ready for use in production. It's still under heavy development. I wrote this for another project I work on right now, but its still far from being stable. Testing are fixes and comments are welcome.

main goal(s):
* console log wrapper for colored log messages
* utilities belt: javascript collection of useful functions that are useful for specific situations, so a lot more specific than underscore
* should work in the browser as well in nodejs

TODOs: 
* use arguments in function to let user pass multiple variables as for original console log
* let user set color with argument color:color_name
* let user change environment with environment:environment_mode
* let user choose default color on initialization
* let user set environment on initialization
* silence console logs on production mode
